# 🗺️ FdF - 3D Wireframe Viewer

## 📌 Description

`FdF` is a 3D wireframe viewer that renders height maps in isometric projection. It reads a file with elevation data and displays a graphical representation of the terrain using the MiniLibX library. The project focuses on low-level rendering, geometric transformations, and event-driven programming in C.
